//This program will allow the user to dictate the size of an array and then fill it with integers, both negative and positive. You will then determine how many of the integers in the array are even and odd, as well as how many are positive and negative. (Count 0 as positive.) Four more arrays will be required to store the values from these categories - evens, odds, positives and negatives. All count data will be printed, followed by the actual values from each category
