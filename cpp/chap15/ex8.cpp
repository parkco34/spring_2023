// Consider the following problem: How many ways can a committee of four people be selected from a group of 10 people? There are many other similar problems, 
// where you are asked to find the number of ways to select a set of items from a given set of items. The general problem can be stated as follows: 
// Find the number of ways r different things can be chosen from a set of n items, where r and n are nonnegative integers and . 
// Suppose C(n, r) denotes the number of ways r different things can be chosen from a set of n items. Then C(n, r) is given by the following formula:
// where the exclamation point denotes the factorial function. Moreover, . It is also known that . (2, 3, 4, 6)
//     Write a recursive algorithm to determine C(n, r). Identify the base case(s) and the general case(s).
//     Using your recursive algorithm, determine C(5, 3) and C(9, 4)
