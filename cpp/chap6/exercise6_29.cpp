//Write a program that prompts the user to enter the area of the flat cardboard. 
//The program then outputs the length and width of the cardboard and the length of the side of 
//the square to be cut from the corner so that the resulting box is of maximum volume. 
//Calculate your answer to three decimal places. Your program must contain a function that takes
//as input the length and width of the cardboard and returns the side of the square that should 
//be cut to maximize the volume. The function also returns the maximum volume.
