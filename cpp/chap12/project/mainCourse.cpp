//Write a program that dynamically tracks these courses using an ARRAY OF OBJECT POINTERS. 
//Every course (both CURRICULUM and CONTINUING education) has a course id, title, room number, and number of contact hours. 
//A CURRICULUM course has credit hours and tuition rate. 
//Tuition is calculated by multiplying the course's credit hours by tuition rate. 
//A CONTINUING EDUCATION course has a flat fee (cost). Implement a show() function in every class that displays the data in the object.
