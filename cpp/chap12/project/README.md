Here's a structure plan for the given instructions:

1. Include necessary headers
   - iostream
   - string

2. Define a base class 'Course'
   - Data members:
     - course id (string)
     - title (string)
     - room number (string)
     - contact hours (int)
   - Member functions:
     - Constructor to initialize data members
     - Pure virtual function 'show()' for displaying course data

3. Define a derived class 'CurriculumCourse' that inherits from 'Course'
   - Additional data members:
     - credit hours (int)
     - tuition rate (double)
   - Member functions:
     - Constructor to initialize data members of CurriculumCourse and base class
     - Function 'calculateTuition()' to calculate tuition by multiplying credit hours by tuition rate
     - Override 'show()' function to display CurriculumCourse data

4. Define a derived class 'ContinuingEducationCourse' that inherits from 'Course'
   - Additional data member:
     - flat fee (double)
   - Member functions:
     - Constructor to initialize data members of ContinuingEducationCourse and base class
     - Override 'show()' function to display ContinuingEducationCourse data

5. Implement the main() function
   - Declare a dynamic array of pointers to Course objects
   - Implement a loop to perform the following tasks:
     - Display a menu with options to add a curriculum course, add a continuing education course, display all courses, or exit
     - Based on the user's choice:
       - Add a new CurriculumCourse or ContinuingEducationCourse object, store its pointer in the dynamic array, and update the number of courses
       - Display all courses by calling the 'show()' function for each object in the dynamic array
       - Exit the program
   - Release allocated memory by deleting each course object and the dynamic array

This structure plan should give you a good starting point for implementing the C++ program as per the given instructions.
