// Write a program that reads four triathlon race time records from a file. 
// The name of the file is racedat.txt. Each line of the file represents one record and contains an athlete identifier (a single character) and three numeric values. 
// The three values are the completion times (in minutes) for the running, swimming, and biking stages of a triathlon. 
// You will produce a nicely formatted report that displays these values, as well as the total time for each athlete. 
// Finally, your report should calculate the average total time for the race. Hint: You may create your own racedat.txt file using Windows Notepad or other text editor. Your input file should have the format: A 31 27 52 B 29 31 58 C 35 36 51 D 34 36 62
